# Cyber Security

This repo documents my Cyber Security learning journey.  
So far, I am covering:

- Owasp Top 10 - 2021
- Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges from various platforms, including Tryhackme, PicoCTF, CyberTalents, and more


I will continue to add more topics and practical exercises as I progress through the course.
